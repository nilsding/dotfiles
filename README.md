# dotfiles

This is an Ansible playbook for configuring a machine the way I want it to.
This includes installing applications I need, and configuring certain apps.

It's very openSUSE Tumbleweed specific as it's what I use every day for
development.  
There is some macOS support in there, too.

## Usage

```
ansible-playbook -K ./dotfiles.yml
```
