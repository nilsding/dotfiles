# dotfiles

This is an Ansible playbook for configuring a machine the way I want it to.
This includes installing applications I need, and configuring certain apps.

Right now it's very macOS specific as it's what I use every day for development.
This may change at a later point though.

## Usage

```
ansible-playbook -K ./dotfiles.yml
```
